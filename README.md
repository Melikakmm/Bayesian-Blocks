# Bayesian Block in R:


The Bayesian Block is a nonparametric analysis of time series data to detect and characterize structure localized in time. The objective of this method is to distinguish between observational errors and statistical significance by finding the optimal segmentation of the data in the observation interval. The name of this method comes from the fact that Bayesian inferece plays a crucial role for estimating parameters of the segments (or blocks) for the model which is maily concerned with finding the best prior for a specific data mode.
